# Spectral-Clustering-A-Python-Implementation

This repository contains code and a paper for a Python implementation of spectral clustering completed as a final partner project for Carnegie Mellon University's Matrices and Linear Transformations course.

Given an input list containing lists representing points in n-dimensional space and an integer *k*, this code outputs a lists assigning each point to one of *k* clusters by using eigenvalues to perform dimensionality reduction before implementing k-means clustering to cluster the reduced data.
